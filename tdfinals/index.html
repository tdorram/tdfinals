<h5>Worms</h5>

<p>Letting your cat outside can be dangerous, no matter how long it begs to go out there. Your first thoughts
may be larger predators, humans, or treacherous adventures. But, there are smaller beings that can harm your
feline! Worms are aquired by cats when they swallow fleas or feces during a grooming session, eating mice or other small 
prey that are infected, or even getting bitten by an infected mosquitoe! The easiest way to prevent this from happening with 
your pet is to keep them indoors. But, for our more adventurous cats who can't live without the thrill of the outdoors, there are 
some more steps that can be taken in order to keep these pets away from your fur babies. 

<h4 style="color: #ffffff;">Ways to Prevent Worms:</h4>
<ul>
<li style="color: #ffffff;">Regular Deworming: Use a deworming treatment on your cat regularly to prevent and kill any existing worms that
    they may have aquired. The treatments usually come in tablets, but can also be injections or skin treatments.
</li>
<li style="color: #ffffff;">Stool Testing: Test your cat's stool at least twice a year if they are indoor cats, and four times
    a year if they are outdoor cats.
</li>
<li style="color: #ffffff;">Keep litter box clean: Keeping your cat's bathroom clean is a very simple step to making sure your cat does not
    attain worms. If they step in infected feces and groom it off of themselves, it can easily infect them.
</li>
<li style="color: #ffffff;">Change food and water bowls: Changing their food and water bowls regularly and even every single day is a simple
    and effective way to prevent worms.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Cat Food</h5>
<p>Being the owner of a cat or a few cats probably means that you want them to be eating 
    food that is good for them but also might not have the money for all the expensive cat foods
    in the stores. Luckily, we found some customer reviewed cat food brands that are both good
     for your pet and aren't crazy expensive. Purina was one of the top ranked cat foods coming in around 
     $25 dollars a bag. Now, $25 dollars might seem a little expensive, but compaired to some $40 bags sitting next to that, that are going 
     to last you the same amount of meals, this is a huge deal! Coming in second place in rank is Friskies cat food! Friskies is a wet cat for, which, is healthier for your 
     cats because it keeps them more hydrated than typical dry cat food would. Even mixing in one portion of wet cat food into your
     cat's diet every day could improve their health! This canned wet food is about $30.00 for 40 cans of food! So that is less than a dollar for 1 can of cat food. One final
     high rated cat food brand is Meow Mix, which prices around $23.00. This brand of cat food is said to be expecially tasty to your cats and also helps improve
     your cats fur coat and keep an overall healthy weight! So, when going to the store for cat food next time, consider looking into these options!

<h5>Preventing Anxiety</h5>

<p>Cats can easily get anxiety and if you don't see the signs, symtoms can get worse and lead to the need 
    of medical attention. Some things that can cause stress in cats are environmental changes, owning other pets,
     loud noises, separation, being handled too much, and being kept in a small space for too long. In order to make sure 
     your cat doesn't get stressed about these things, it is best to make sure they are slowly welcomed to their new home and 
     fellow pets, as well as given a good amount of attention and space to roam. Even having cat beds, houses, or even hidden spaces for them
      to go when they feel they need to be left alone, cat greatly benifit you and your cat! Sme things pet owners like to do to entertain their cats 
      is to play soothing music or turn on a nature show for them to watch. Provided below, are some options.
